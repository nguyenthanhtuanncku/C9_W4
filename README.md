Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown Presentation & Plotly
Submit by May 28, 11:59 PM PDT
Important Information
It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, May 28, 11:59 PM PDT, because it must be graded by others. If you submit late, there may not be enough classmates around to review your work. This makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid these risks.

Instructions

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
Review criterialess 
The rubric contains the following two questions:

Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?
